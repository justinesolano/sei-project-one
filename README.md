## Description
Frodder is a Lord of the Rings-themed grid-based game inspired by the 1981 arcade classic Frogger. The player as Frodo must pass several rows of obstacles and try and reach the objective at the top of the grid which is 'The Prancing Pony' inn featured in the Lord of the Rings. The game is based on the Fellowship of the Ring movie sequence where Frodo, Samwise, Merry and Pippin are being chased by the Nazg√ªl until they reach the town of Bree to meet Gandalf at the inn.
